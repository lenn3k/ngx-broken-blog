# BrokenBlog

Unsecured forum application in Angular.

Created for educational purposes in a Jworks security CC workshop.

To be used with [broken-blog](https://github.com/jmeys/broken-blog).


This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.1.

## Getting set up

Download and install the latest version of [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/)(created with 9.8.0)

Install the angular CLI to build and run the front-end

`npm install -g @angular/cli`

Run `npm install` 


## Actually running the front-end

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

If you make changes to config files it is best to restart the dev server.



## Setting up KeyCloak (on Frontend)

Install the oauth2 and  oidc package from npm with `$ npm install --save angular-oauth2-oidc `
